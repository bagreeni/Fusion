This Android app is a task manager that is designed to be simple
yet highly customizable.

The paul branch is currently the same as master, and the "add a task" 
button from the brook branch is present in both.  In these, enter a 
task into the input field, and click on the button to add a task
to the database.  

In the maddie branch, it is possible to open a navigation drawer by
either the the press of the nav drawer button in the upper left corner
or through a left to right swipe.
