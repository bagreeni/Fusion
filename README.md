This Android app is a task manager that is designed to be simple
yet highly customizable.

The app currently features a navigation drawer with a dynamic list of categories 
associated with the tasks in the database.  Additionally, a user can input a task 
using the add task button in the lower right corner of the main activity, which 
will open up a new activity for entering a task and associated categories to be 
added to the database.  Once a task is entered, the app will go back to the main activity,
where a recycler view is used to display tasks and their associated categories. While in
this view, the user can now swipe right to edit a task, or swipe left to delete a task.
Alternatively they can also hit the 'done' button to delete a task.
